# **Guide: Review and Suggestions for Bank Account Manager Program**

---

## **1. Strengths of Your Code**
Your code demonstrates excellent use of **OOP principles** and good problem-solving skills. Below are the key strengths:

- **Encapsulation**:
  - Attributes (`accountNumber` and `balance`) are private and accessed using getter and setter methods, protecting the data from unauthorized modification.

- **Core Features**:
  - The program allows the user to deposit money, withdraw funds, and check their balance effectively.

- **User Interaction**:
  - A menu-driven interface provides a clear and interactive way for users to navigate the program.

- **Repeat Menu**:
  - Using a `do-while` loop ensures the menu is displayed repeatedly until the user decides to exit.

- **Error Feedback**:
  - Clear messages indicate the success or failure of operations (e.g., insufficient balance, invalid input).

## **2. Suggestions for Improvement**
Here are areas where your program can be enhanced:

### **a. Input Validation**
- Handle invalid inputs (e.g., entering letters instead of numbers for deposit/withdrawal amounts).
  - **Solution**:
    ```cpp
    if (cin.fail()) {
        cin.clear();
        cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');
        cout << "Invalid input! Please enter a number.\n";
    }
    ```

### **b. Code Structure**
- Refactor the `main` function to improve readability:
  - Move the menu display into a separate function: `showMenu()`.
  - Create helper functions for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry:
    - `handleDeposit(BankAccount& account)`
    - `handleWithdrawal(BankAccount& account)`
    - `handleBalanceInquiry(BankAccount& account)`

### **c. Input Validation for Transactions**
- Ensure that deposit and withdrawal amounts are positive numbers:
  ```cpp
  if (dep <= 0) {
      cout << "Deposit amount must be greater than zero.\n";
      return;
  }
